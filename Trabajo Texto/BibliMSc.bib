               columns are on one searchable CD! Martin Gardner's
               ``Mathematical Games'' column ran in Scientific American from
               1956 to 1986. In these columns, Gardner introduced hundreds of
               thousands of readers to the delights of mathematics and of
               puzzles and problem solving. His column broke such stories as
               Rivest, Shamir and Adelman on public-key cryptography,
               Mandelbrot on fractals, Conway on Life, and Penrose on tilings.
               He enlivened classic geometry and number theory and introduced
               readers to new areas such as combinatorics and graph theory. The
               CD contains the following articles: (1) Hexaflexagons and Other
               Mathematical Diversions; (2) The Second Scientific American Book
               of Mathematical Puzzles and Diversions; (3) New Mathematical
               Diversions; (4) The Unexpected Hanging and Other Mathematical
               Diversions; (5) Martin Gardner's 6th Book of Mathematical
               Diversions from Scientific American; (6) Mathematical Carnival;
               (7) Mathematical Magic Show; (8) Mathematical Circus; (9) The
               Magic Numbers of Dr. Matrix; (10) Wheels, Life, and Other
               Mathematical Amusements; (11) Knotted Doughnuts and Other
               Mathematical Entertainers; (12) Time Travel and Other
               Mathematical Bewilderments; (13) Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor
               Ciphers; (14) Fractal Music, Hypercards, and more Mathematical
               Recreations from Scientific American and (15) The Last
               Recreations: Hydras, Eggs, and Other Mathematical
               Mystifications. A profile and interview with Martin Gardner is
